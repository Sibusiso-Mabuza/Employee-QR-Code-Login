**Project Description: Inventory Management Web App with QR Code Login**

**Overview:**
The Inventory Management Web App is a comprehensive solution aimed at helping businesses efficiently manage their inventory of products or materials. The app provides users with a user-friendly web interface to view inventory details in both list and graphical formats. To enhance security and streamline user authentication, the app employs a QR code-based login system, requiring users to utilize an Android Studio application to scan QR codes displayed on the website. The technologies utilized in this project include ASP.NET Core MVC for the web app, MySQL for the database, Node.js for server-side functionality, and Android Studio for the QR code login application.

**Key Features:**
1. **Inventory Display**: The web app offers a clear and organized list view of the inventory, including product names, descriptions, SKUs, and quantities.

2. **Graphical Representation**: Users can also access graphical representations (charts or graphs) that provide insights into inventory trends, turnover rates, and other relevant metrics.

3. **QR Code-Based Login**: To enhance security and streamline user access, a companion Android Studio application is developed. Users scan QR codes displayed on the website using this app, which then securely sends the user details to the website for authentication.

4. **User Authentication and Access Control**: The app ensures that only authorized users can access and manage inventory data. User roles and permissions can be defined, allowing different levels of access for various personnel.

5. **Real-time Inventory Updates**: The web app integrates with the database using Node.js to ensure real-time updates of inventory data, helping users make informed decisions promptly.

6. **Low Stock Notifications**: The app can be configured to send notifications when inventory levels reach specified thresholds, enabling timely reordering.

7. **Supplier and Vendor Management**: Users can manage supplier information and associate products with respective suppliers for streamlined procurement.

8. **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed with responsiveness in mind, allowing users to access and manage inventory from various devices.

9. **Data Visualization**: Through interactive charts and graphs, users can visually analyze inventory patterns and make strategic decisions.

**Technology Stack:**
1. **ASP.NET Core MVC**: The primary framework for building the web application, offering a structured architecture and seamless integration with frontend and backend components.

2. **MySQL**: A robust relational database management system for storing and managing inventory data securely.

3. **Node.js**: Used on the server side to enable real-time updates, handle API requests, and manage database interactions efficiently.

4. **Android Studio**: The development environment used to create the companion Android app for QR code scanning and user login.

5. **RESTful APIs**: Communication between the web app and the Android app is facilitated through RESTful APIs, ensuring smooth data transfer and interaction.

6. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for creating the user interface and enhancing user experience.

7. **Charting Libraries**: JavaScript charting libraries (such as Chart.js or D3.js) are employed to create interactive and visually appealing graphs.

**Conclusion:**
This Inventory Management Web App project showcases your expertise as a software developer by integrating multiple technologies to create a comprehensive solution. The combination of ASP.NET Core MVC, MySQL, Node.js, and Android Studio demonstrates your ability to design and implement a sophisticated system that addresses real-world business needs. The project not only highlights your technical skills but also your problem-solving capabilities in creating an intuitive and secure inventory management system.
